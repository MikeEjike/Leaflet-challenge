Visualizing an earthquake data set.

1. **Getting the data set**

   ![3-Data](Images/3-Data.png)

   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. The [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page has data sets to choose from, like 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days' and give a JSON representation of that data.

2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

   A map is created using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.
